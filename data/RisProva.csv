Chef/owner Mr. Yim Jung Sik and Executive Chef Daeik Kim's Korean meal starts like many do, with an array of banchan; however, the presentation here is unlike any other; and it's just that creativity that makes dining here so distinctive. From there, the tasting menu unfolds to reveals delights such as slivers of raw striped jack with white kimchi and chilled fish bone broth; gorgeously crisped octopus with gochujang aioli; and dry-aged Arctic char in a pool of kimchi and red curry sauce. This is cooking that is highly original, impeccably executed, and enormously satisfying; a meal that makes you involuntarily nod to yourself while you’re eating.§3§

Such is the appeal of the place.There are two menus, one of which is vegetarian and may highlight a playful twist on borscht, with red beet agnolotti and crème fraîche. Both menus end in a grand dessert finale, like seasonal confections as well as such classics as a cappuccino semifreddo served with brioche donuts. They do offer supplements using lavish ingredients, but unless you’re richer than Croesus, you needn’t consider them. Just put yourself in the chef's hands and relish a meal that is balanced, varied and as seasonal as it gets.§4§

The freshly baked, delicately crisped vegan roll presented with faux butter is a magical creation. A quenelle of tonburi, mimicking caviar, plated with horseradish cream and accompanied by a radish tostada with a swipe of pumpkin seed butter is simply stunning. Toothsome braised seitan, wrapped in spinach and dressed with morels, is amplified with luscious sauce work.Desserts, perhaps a frozen cherry blossom and rose confection dressed with strawberries, are equally accomplished.§6§

The commotion of Columbus Circle gives way to the calm, collected ceremony of a room anchored by a strikingly smooth hinoki counter. Everything is in place, as chefs and servers work with a kind of harmony that recalls ballet. Every decision, every move, is in the service of his distinctive style, which many have copied but none have mastered. Fragrant white and black truffles, pearly beads of Osetra caviar, and vibrant garnishes make for brilliant touches that straddle the line between luxury and excess. Few have both the imagination and the know-how to make foie gras nigiri, and few serve abalone so meltingly tender. It is a captivating experience that is singularly memorable.§7§

In a town whose very existence seems tied to his success, dinner here recalls another era. The dining room is embellished to the very last inch, with fringe and fabric all over, patterned carpets, and lush wallpaper. The menu is divided between classics and vegetables, most of which are sourced locally and from the team’s own garden. Dinner always begins with pimento cheese packed into a crisp chip and ends with a playful pear dessert. In between, courses like lobster with caviar beurre blanc show the kitchen at its very best. And all throughout, roaming bread and cheese carts are a reminder of a luxury that’s less and less common.§8§

Their cooking is bold and often pushes boundaries, all the while impressing. Sheer creativity is applied to seasonal produce, some of which comes from their garden. A quail egg, gently smoked and topped with caviar, is given a twist with barley caramel. Resting inside its shell, plump Maine uni, amplified with a divine peach gel and wasabi cream, is both stunning and memorable. The chef's creativity is on full display in an utterly unique Dungeness crab dish, while wagyu sided by a truffle-flavored doughnut with marrow glaze is yet another hit. Savory sweets, like new potato ice cream, a corn macaron with peppery nasturtium, or the dark chocolate tartlet studded with kombu, raise the bar.§9§

To do this, it has adapted its architecture and produce, and integrated new technologies in its quest to become a responsible restaurant business that aims to cook for a better future. Chef Eneko Atxa nurtures a sapling of the Tree of Gernika at the entrance of the restaurant in a manifestation of his desire to preserve the area's indigenous flora and fauna, to safeguard the values of Basque culture, and to offer guests a creative and informative culinary experience that is dedicated to the conservation of endemic species. His single tasting menu (Adarrak) includes an informative tour of the premises, such as the picnic served in a wicker basket in front of a vertical garden, snacks in a space decorated with recycled organic materials, and maritime-inspired appetisers in the corridor of the kitchen so you can watch its chefs hard at work.

As he says himself, at Aponiente “the aim is to raise awareness, open people's minds and introduce them to new concepts that are impossible to find anywhere else”. Totally committed to sustainability, this is a chef who seeks to surprise diners with new techniques and ingredients (such as seafood sausages, plankton, bioluminescence, cooking with seawater etc), always honing a philosophy which revolves around recycling, making the most of what the natural estuaries have to offer and championing the salvaging of discarded fish. His contemporary cuisine, based around resources from both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, provides further surprises on the dessert menu, on which dishes somehow manage to combine the maritime world with sweeter textures (his “20 leagues under the sea”, a seaweed millefeuille presented inside a book by Jules Verne, is a particular delight).§13§

As a result, he ensures a rollercoaster of emotions that constantly challenge the palate. In this striking setting, the single “Flying Pigs Cuisine” tasting menu invites his guests on a spectacular journey across the world’s different cuisines, including Asian fusion, but with the predominant use of Spanish ingredients to help create more recognisable flavours. Highlighting themes such as invasive species and the Pyrenean ecosystem, the chef works without limits, combining local ingredients with exotic condiments.

In the restaurant's bright interior, with its open kitchen and incredible interior design, chef Paco Morales (ably supported by second in command Paola Gualandi) revives the spirit of Andalusian cuisine using modern ideas and techniques. Every season, the restaurant explores a different historical period, currently the “Golden Age”, as part of which three menus (Mudéjar, Morisco and Al-Yazira) reinterpret the splendour of the 16C and 17C. Standout dishes here include the durum wheat with smoked butter and chicken and calamari broth (a reinterpretation of the Abbasiya recipe) and the locally grown oranges with orange blossom, fried almonds and extra virgin olive oil for dessert.§15§

Always sporting his trademark cap, chef Jesús Sánchez runs the restaurant with the invaluable support of wife Marián Martínez, who is charge of the front of house. He remains consistently loyal to local ingredients, seasonality and to a firm commitment to sustainability via his surprise “La Gran Experiencia” menu, a heartfelt tribute to his natural surroundings, his Cantabrian identity and its history, and all the painstaking research that has gone into every bite. As an example, the sourdough bread baked on the premises always receives fulsome praise. We highly recommend taking a stroll through the small vegetable garden in the grounds and admiring the photos on display which highlight another of the chef’s great passions.§16§

Based on the iconic signature dishes of the house, it also includes other lesser-known creations, which, in the hands of this chef, are the source of unexpected details and harmonies of flavour.
